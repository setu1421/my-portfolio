I am a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, where I work in the [WSPR](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) lab and [Realsearch](https://realsearchgroup.github.io/) group under the supervision of [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/lawilli3). I am interested in data-driven discovery and analytics to validate, evolve, and solidify the theory and practice of software security. To keep pace with the increasing reliance on secure software in our daily life and industry, it is an open query for all practitioners to detect security breaches at the earliest phase of SDLC. My current research is focused on risk-based software secret management. My recent research includes the challenges developers face about checked-in secrets in software artifacts and finding the best practices for secret management in software artifacts. In addition, I have curated SecretBench, a benchmark dataset for future researchers, and used the dataset to find the efficiency and effectiveness of secret detection tools. All these works have been published at International conferences such as ICSE, MSR, ESEM, and SecDev.

Previously, I worked at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/) for five years, where I developed dental practice management and opportunity model analysis software. Before that, I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from [Khulna University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/).

I am actively looking for summer internship positions as a Research Scientist or Software Engineer, so feel free to message me if your team is hiring!
